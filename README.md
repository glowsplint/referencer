# Referencer

Referencer is a Bible study annotation tool which makes it easy to cross-reference multiple passages from different parts of the Bible. It is written in React (via Next.JS) and TypeScript.

## To-do

### Selecting a passage

- As a user, I want to be able to create a room so that I can collaborate in real-time with other people.

  - Requires websocket support
  - Requires backend room design

- As a user, I want to be able to manage my available layers.

  1. Layer names should be visible
  2. Layers should have on/off functionality

- As a user, I want to be able to highlight words and phrases within the passage. These should also appear as layers within the colours section.
