Referencer is a web-based online Bible study annotation tool which makes it easy to cross-reference multiple passages from different parts of the Bible. It is written in React (via Next.js), TypeScript and Python.

### Features

Referencer allows you to:

1. Cross-reference different parts of the Bible side-by-side
2. Make highlights, inline annotations and draw arrows
3. Group ideas in different layers

### Controls

1. Drag your left-click to make text selections.
2. Press the Ctrl key before dragging your left click to draw arrows.

# Development

This repository is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Requirements

You will need:

1. Node.js installed to run the front-end development server. You can get the latest version from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).
2. Python interpreter installed to run the back-end development server. You can get the latest version from [here](https://www.python.org/).

### Front-end development

The preferred method uses the yarn package manager.

To run the front-end development server, run:

```bash
# if you don't have the yarn package manager installed
npm install -g yarn

# to run the front-end dev server
cd frontend
yarn install
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser.

To export and build the front-end static assets, run:

```bash
cd frontend
yarn build
```

This will generate the static assets in `.\frontend\out`, which are required by the back-end development server in the next step.

### Back-end development

The back-end development server is written in Python. When run, it will serve the front-end static assets. You will need to first export and build the front-end static assets (with steps above) before running this step.

You will also need to install the Python dependencies by running from the root directory:

Using pipenv:

```bash
# if you don't have pipenv
pip install pipenv

# install dependencies into a virtualenv
pipenv install

# to run the back-end dev server
py run.py
```

Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) with your browser to see the back-end development server serving the exported front-end static assets.

### Deployment

The production server can be run as follows:

```bash
# build the latest front-end static assets
cd frontend
yarn build

# run the production server
cd ..
py run.py
```

You will need to supply a `.env` file in the root directory with a valid ESV API key.

Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) with your browser to see the production server.
