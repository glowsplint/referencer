      "Psalm 9\n\nI Will Recount Your Wonderful Deeds\n\n(1) To the choirmaster: according to Muth-labben.(2) A Psalm of David.\n\n    [1] I will give thanks to the LORD with my whole heart;\n        I will recount all of your wonderful deeds.\n    [2] I will be glad and exult in you;\n        I will sing praise to your name, O Most High.\n    \n    \n    [3] When my enemies turn back,\n        they stumble and perish before(3) your presence.\n    [4] For you have maintained my just cause;\n        you have sat on the throne, giving righteous judgment.\n    \n    \n    [5] You have rebuked the nations; you have made the wicked perish;\n        you have blotted out their name forever and ever.\n    [6] The enemy came to an end in everlasting ruins;\n        their cities you rooted out;\n        the very memory of them has perished.\n    \n    \n    [7] But the LORD sits enthroned forever;\n        he has established his throne for justice,\n    [8] and he judges the world with righteousness;\n        he judges the peoples with uprightness.\n    \n    \n    [9] The LORD is a stronghold for the oppressed,\n        a stronghold in times of trouble.\n    [10] And those who know your name put their trust in you,\n        for you, O LORD, have not forsaken those who seek you.\n    \n    \n    [11] Sing praises to the LORD, who sits enthroned in Zion!\n        Tell among the peoples his deeds!\n    [12] For he who avenges blood is mindful of them;\n        he does not forget the cry of the afflicted.\n    \n    \n    [13] Be gracious to me, O LORD!\n        See my affliction from those who hate me,\n        O you who lift me up from the gates of death,\n    [14] that I may recount all your praises,\n        that in the gates of the daughter of Zion\n        I may rejoice in your salvation.\n    \n    \n    [15] The nations have sunk in the pit that they made;\n        in the net that they hid, their own foot has been caught.\n    [16] The LORD has made himself known; he has executed judgment;\n        the wicked are snared in the work of their own hands. Higgaion.(4) Selah\n    \n    \n    [17] The wicked shall return to Sheol,\n        all the nations that forget God.\n    \n    \n    [18] For the needy shall not always be forgotten,\n        and the hope of the poor shall not perish forever.\n    \n    \n    [19] Arise, O LORD! Let not man prevail;\n        let the nations be judged before you!\n    [20] Put them in fear, O LORD!\n        Let the nations know that they are but men! Selah\n    \n\nFootnotes\n\n(1) 9:1 Psalms 9 and 10 together follow an acrostic pattern, each stanza beginning with the successive letters of the Hebrew alphabet. In the Septuagint they form one psalm\n\n(2) 9:1 Probably a musical or liturgical term\n\n(3) 9:3 Or *because of*\n\n(4) 9:16 Probably a musical or liturgical term\n (ESV)",
