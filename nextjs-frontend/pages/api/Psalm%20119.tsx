      "Psalm 119\n\nYour Word Is a Lamp to My Feet\n\nAleph\n\n    [1] (1) Blessed are those whose way is blameless,\n        who walk in the law of the LORD!\n    [2] Blessed are those who keep his testimonies,\n        who seek him with their whole heart,\n    [3] who also do no wrong,\n        but walk in his ways!\n    [4] You have commanded your precepts\n        to be kept diligently.\n    [5] Oh that my ways may be steadfast\n        in keeping your statutes!\n    [6] Then I shall not be put to shame,\n        having my eyes fixed on all your commandments.\n    [7] I will praise you with an upright heart,\n        when I learn your righteous rules.(2)\n    [8] I will keep your statutes;\n        do not utterly forsake me!\n    \n    \n    Beth\n\n    [9] How can a young man keep his way pure?\n        By guarding it according to your word.\n    [10] With my whole heart I seek you;\n        let me not wander from your commandments!\n    [11] I have stored up your word in my heart,\n        that I might not sin against you.\n    [12] Blessed are you, O LORD;\n        teach me your statutes!\n    [13] With my lips I declare\n        all the rules(3) of your mouth.\n    [14] In the way of your testimonies I delight\n        as much as in all riches.\n    [15] I will meditate on your precepts\n        and fix my eyes on your ways.\n    [16] I will delight in your statutes;\n        I will not forget your word.\n    \n    \n    Gimel\n\n    [17] Deal bountifully with your servant,\n        that I may live and keep your word.\n    [18] Open my eyes, that I may behold\n        wondrous things out of your law.\n    [19] I am a sojourner on the earth;\n        hide not your commandments from me!\n    [20] My soul is consumed with longing\n        for your rules(4) at all times.\n    [21] You rebuke the insolent, accursed ones,\n        who wander from your commandments.\n    [22] Take away from me scorn and contempt,\n        for I have kept your testimonies.\n    [23] Even though princes sit plotting against me,\n        your servant will meditate on your statutes.\n    [24] Your testimonies are my delight;\n        they are my counselors.\n    \n    \n    Daleth\n\n    [25] My soul clings to the dust;\n        give me life according to your word!\n    [26] When I told of my ways, you answered me;\n        teach me your statutes!\n    [27] Make me understand the way of your precepts,\n        and I will meditate on your wondrous works.\n    [28] My soul melts away for sorrow;\n        strengthen me according to your word!\n    [29] Put false ways far from me\n        and graciously teach me your law!\n    [30] I have chosen the way of faithfulness;\n        I set your rules before me.\n    [31] I cling to your testimonies, O LORD;\n        let me not be put to shame!\n    [32] I will run in the way of your commandments\n        when you enlarge my heart!(5)\n    \n    \n    He\n\n    [33] Teach me, O LORD, the way of your statutes;\n        and I will keep it to the end.(6)\n    [34] Give me understanding, that I may keep your law\n        and observe it with my whole heart.\n    [35] Lead me in the path of your commandments,\n        for I delight in it.\n    [36] Incline my heart to your testimonies,\n        and not to selfish gain!\n    [37] Turn my eyes from looking at worthless things;\n        and give me life in your ways.\n    [38] Confirm to your servant your promise,\n        that you may be feared.\n    [39] Turn away the reproach that I dread,\n        for your rules are good.\n    [40] Behold, I long for your precepts;\n        in your righteousness give me life!\n    \n    \n    Waw\n\n    [41] Let your steadfast love come to me, O LORD,\n        your salvation according to your promise;\n    [42] then shall I have an answer for him who taunts me,\n        for I trust in your word.\n    [43] And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth,\n        for my hope is in your rules.\n    [44] I will keep your law continually,\n        forever and ever,\n    [45] and I shall walk in a wide place,\n        for I have sought your precepts.\n    [46] I will also speak of your testimonies before kings\n        and shall not be put to shame,\n    [47] for I find my delight in your commandments,\n        which I love.\n    [48] I will lift up my hands toward your commandments, which I love,\n        and I will meditate on your statutes.\n    \n    \n    Zayin\n\n    [49] Remember your word to your servant,\n        in which you have made me hope.\n    [50] This is my comfort in my affliction,\n        that your promise gives me life.\n    [51] The insolent utterly deride me,\n        but I do not turn away from your law.\n    [52] When I think of your rules from of old,\n        I take comfort, O LORD.\n    [53] Hot indignation seizes me because of the wicked,\n        who forsake your law.\n    [54] Your statutes have been my songs\n        in the house of my sojourning.\n    [55] I remember your name in the night, O LORD,\n        and keep your law.\n    [56] This blessing has fallen to me,\n        that I have kept your precepts.\n    \n    \n    Heth\n\n    [57] The LORD is my portion;\n        I promise to keep your words.\n    [58] I entreat your favor with all my heart;\n        be gracious to me according to your promise.\n    [59] When I think on my ways,\n        I turn my feet to your testimonies;\n    [60] I hasten and do not delay\n        to keep your commandments.\n    [61] Though the cords of the wicked ensnare me,\n        I do not forget your law.\n    [62] At midnight I rise to praise you,\n        because of your righteous rules.\n    [63] I am a companion of all who fear you,\n        of those who keep your precepts.\n    [64] The earth, O LORD, is full of your steadfast love;\n        teach me your statutes!\n    \n    \n    Teth\n\n    [65] You have dealt well with your servant,\n        O LORD, according to your word.\n    [66] Teach me good judgment and knowledge,\n        for I believe in your commandments.\n    [67] Before I was afflicted I went astray,\n        but now I keep your word.\n    [68] You are good and do good;\n        teach me your statutes.\n    [69] The insolent smear me with lies,\n        but with my whole heart I keep your precepts;\n    [70] their heart is unfeeling like fat,\n        but I delight in your law.\n    [71] It is good for me that I was afflicted,\n        that I might learn your statutes.\n    [72] The law of your mouth is better to me\n        than thousands of gold and silver pieces.\n    \n    \n    Yodh\n\n    [73] Your hands have made and fashioned me;\n        give me understanding that I may learn your commandments.\n    [74] Those who fear you shall see me and rejoice,\n        because I have hoped in your word.\n    [75] I know, O LORD, that your rules are righteous,\n        and that in faithfulness you have afflicted me.\n    [76] Let your steadfast love comfort me\n        according to your promise to your servant.\n    [77] Let your mercy come to me, that I may live;\n        for your law is my delight.\n    [78] Let the insolent be put to shame,\n        because they have wronged me with falsehood;\n        as for me, I will meditate on your precepts.\n    [79] Let those who fear you turn to me,\n        that they may know your testimonies.\n    [80] May my heart be blameless in your statutes,\n        that I may not be put to shame!\n    \n    \n    Kaph\n\n    [81] My soul longs for your salvation;\n        I hope in your word.\n    [82] My eyes long for your promise;\n        I ask, “When will you comfort me?”\n    [83] For I have become like a wineskin in the smoke,\n        yet I have not forgotten your statutes.\n    [84] How long must your servant endure?(7)\n        When will you judge those who persecute me?\n    [85] The insolent have dug pitfalls for me;\n        they do not live according to your law.\n    [86] All your commandments are sure;\n        they persecute me with falsehood; help me!\n    [87] They have almost made an end of me on earth,\n        but I have not forsaken your precepts.\n    [88] In your steadfast love give me life,\n        that I may keep the testimonies of your mouth.\n    \n    \n    Lamedh\n\n    [89] Forever, O LORD, your word\n        is firmly fixed in the heavens.\n    [90] Your faithfulness endures to all generations;\n        you have established the earth, and it stands fast.\n    [91] By your appointment they stand this day,\n        for all things are your servants.\n    [92] If your law had not been my delight,\n        I would have perished in my affliction.\n    [93] I will never forget your precepts,\n        for by them you have given me life.\n    [94] I am yours; save me,\n        for I have sought your precepts.\n    [95] The wicked lie in wait to destroy me,\n        but I consider your testimonies.\n    [96] I have seen a limit to all perfection,\n        but your commandment is exceedingly broad.\n    \n    \n    Mem\n\n    [97] Oh how I love your law!\n        It is my meditation all the day.\n    [98] Your commandment makes me wiser than my enemies,\n        for it is ever with me.\n    [99] I have more understanding than all my teachers,\n        for your testimonies are my meditation.\n    [100] I understand more than the aged,(8)\n        for I keep your precepts.\n    [101] I hold back my feet from every evil way,\n        in order to keep your word.\n    [102] I do not turn aside from your rules,\n        for you have taught me.\n    [103] How sweet are your words to my taste,\n        sweeter than honey to my mouth!\n    [104] Through your precepts I get understanding;\n        therefore I hate every false way.\n    \n    \n    Nun\n\n    [105] Your word is a lamp to my feet\n        and a light to my path.\n    [106] I have sworn an oath and confirmed it,\n        to keep your righteous rules.\n    [107] I am severely afflicted;\n        give me life, O LORD, according to your word!\n    [108] Accept my freewill offerings of praise, O LORD,\n        and teach me your rules.\n    [109] I hold my life in my hand continually,\n        but I do not forget your law.\n    [110] The wicked have laid a snare for me,\n        but I do not stray from your precepts.\n    [111] Your testimonies are my heritage forever,\n        for they are the joy of my heart.\n    [112] I incline my heart to perform your statutes\n        forever, to the end.(9)\n    \n    \n    Samekh\n\n    [113] I hate the double-minded,\n        but I love your law.\n    [114] You are my hiding place and my shield;\n        I hope in your word.\n    [115] Depart from me, you evildoers,\n        that I may keep the commandments of my God.\n    [116] Uphold me according to your promise, that I may live,\n        and let me not be put to shame in my hope!\n    [117] Hold me up, that I may be safe\n        and have regard for your statutes continually!\n    [118] You spurn all who go astray from your statutes,\n        for their cunning is in vain.\n    [119] All the wicked of the earth you discard like dross,\n        therefore I love your testimonies.\n    [120] My flesh trembles for fear of you,\n        and I am afraid of your judgments.\n    \n    \n    Ayin\n\n    [121] I have done what is just and right;\n        do not leave me to my oppressors.\n    [122] Give your servant a pledge of good;\n        let not the insolent oppress me.\n    [123] My eyes long for your salvation\n        and for the fulfillment of your righteous promise.\n    [124] Deal with your servant according to your steadfast love,\n        and teach me your statutes.\n    [125] I am your servant; give me understanding,\n        that I may know your testimonies!\n    [126] It is time for the LORD to act,\n        for your law has been broken.\n    [127] Therefore I love your commandments\n        above gold, above fine gold.\n    [128] Therefore I consider all your precepts to be right;\n        I hate every false way.\n    \n    \n    Pe\n\n    [129] Your testimonies are wonderful;\n        therefore my soul keeps them.\n    [130] The unfolding of your words gives light;\n        it imparts understanding to the simple.\n    [131] I open my mouth and pant,\n        because I long for your commandments.\n    [132] Turn to me and be gracious to me,\n        as is your way with those who love your name.\n    [133] Keep steady my steps according to your promise,\n        and let no iniquity get dominion over me.\n    [134] Redeem me from man’s oppression,\n        that I may keep your precepts.\n    [135] Make your face shine upon your servant,\n        and teach me your statutes.\n    [136] My eyes shed streams of tears,\n        because people do not keep your law.\n    \n    \n    Tsadhe\n\n    [137] Righteous are you, O LORD,\n        and right are your rules.\n    [138] You have appointed your testimonies in righteousness\n        and in all faithfulness.\n    [139] My zeal consumes me,\n        because my foes forget your words.\n    [140] Your promise is well tried,\n        and your servant loves it.\n    [141] I am small and despised,\n        yet I do not forget your precepts.\n    [142] Your righteousness is righteous forever,\n        and your law is true.\n    [143] Trouble and anguish have found me out,\n        but your commandments are my delight.\n    [144] Your testimonies are righteous forever;\n        give me understanding that I may live.\n    \n    \n    Qoph\n\n    [145] With my whole heart I cry; answer me, O LORD!\n        I will keep your statutes.\n    [146] I call to you; save me,\n        that I may observe your testimonies.\n    [147] I rise before dawn and cry for help;\n        I hope in your words.\n    [148] My eyes are awake before the watches of the night,\n        that I may meditate on your promise.\n    [149] Hear my voice according to your steadfast love;\n        O LORD, according to your justice give me life.\n    [150] They draw near who persecute me with evil purpose;\n        they are far from your law.\n    [151] But you are near, O LORD,\n        and all your commandments are true.\n    [152] Long have I known from your testimonies\n        that you have founded them forever.\n    \n    \n    Resh\n\n    [153] Look on my affliction and deliver me,\n        for I do not forget your law.\n    [154] Plead my cause and redeem me;\n        give me life according to your promise!\n    [155] Salvation is far from the wicked,\n        for they do not seek your statutes.\n    [156] Great is your mercy, O LORD;\n        give me life according to your rules.\n    [157] Many are my persecutors and my adversaries,\n        but I do not swerve from your testimonies.\n    [158] I look at the faithless with disgust,\n        because they do not keep your commands.\n    [159] Consider how I love your precepts!\n        Give me life according to your steadfast love.\n    [160] The sum of your word is truth,\n        and every one of your righteous rules endures forever.\n    \n    \n    Sin and Shin\n\n    [161] Princes persecute me without cause,\n        but my heart stands in awe of your words.\n    [162] I rejoice at your word\n        like one who finds great spoil.\n    [163] I hate and abhor falsehood,\n        but I love your law.\n    [164] Seven times a day I praise you\n        for your righteous rules.\n    [165] Great peace have those who love your law;\n        nothing can make them stumble.\n    [166] I hope for your salvation, O LORD,\n        and I do your commandments.\n    [167] My soul keeps your testimonies;\n        I love them exceedingly.\n    [168] I keep your precepts and testimonies,\n        for all my ways are before you.\n    \n    \n    Taw\n\n    [169] Let my cry come before you, O LORD;\n        give me understanding according to your word!\n    [170] Let my plea come before you;\n        deliver me according to your word.\n    [171] My lips will pour forth praise,\n        for you teach me your statutes.\n    [172] My tongue will sing of your word,\n        for all your commandments are right.\n    [173] Let your hand be ready to help me,\n        for I have chosen your precepts.\n    [174] I long for your salvation, O LORD,\n        and your law is my delight.\n    [175] Let my soul live and praise you,\n        and let your rules help me.\n    [176] I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek your servant,\n        for I do not forget your commandments.\n    \n\nFootnotes\n\n(1) 119:1 This psalm is an acrostic poem of twenty-two stanzas, following the letters of the Hebrew
