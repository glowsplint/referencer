## Getting Started

### Requirements

You will need Node.js installed on your computer to run the development server. You can get the latest version from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install (preferred)
```

If you don't have `yarn` installed, run `npm install -g yarn`.

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev (preferred)
```
