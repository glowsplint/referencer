        "question": "Eh this app is what sia?",
        "answer": "Referencer is a collaborative tool for inductive Bible study lah. It gives study groups a shared workspace where everyone can read, annotate, and discuss Scripture together in real time. Very shiok one!"
      },
      "inductiveStudy": {
        "question": "Inductive Bible study — what's that ah?",
        "answer": "It's a method where you read Scripture from observation (what the text say?) to interpretation (what it mean?) to application (how it apply to your life?). Instead of straightaway look at commentary, you let the text speak for itself first. Like that more power lah!"
      },
      "collaboration": {
        "question": "How the collaboration work one?",
        "answer": "Each workspace can share with others via a link. Everyone see the same text and can add their own annotations. Changes sync in real time so nobody blur blur one. Confirm plus chop everyone on the same page!"
      },
      "layers": {
        "question": "What are layers ah?",
        "answer": "Layers let you organize annotations into separate groups — for example, one layer for observations, another for interpretations. Press L to cycle between them. Damn neat one, like organizing your hawker centre tray."
      },
      "annotations": {
        "question": "How the annotations work ah?",
        "answer": "Lock the editor (press K), then select text to highlight it. Can choose colors, add comments, draw arrows between annotations to show connections. Click an existing annotation to remove it. Easy peasy lemon squeezy!"
      },
      "arrows": {
        "question": "What the arrows for sia?",
        "answer": "Arrows connect two annotations to show they got relationship — like linking a repeated word to where it first appear, or connecting a prophecy to its fulfillment. Press A, then click two annotations. Wah, very the connected!"
      },
      "sharing": {
        "question": "How to share workspace leh?",

      },
      "mobile": {
        "question": "Can use on phone anot?",
        "answer": "Can lah, the app works in mobile browsers. But the full annotation and arrow tools best on desktop with keyboard and mouse one. Phone screen too small, later eye pain!"
