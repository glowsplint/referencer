Amos;3;10;"“They do not know how to do right,” declares the Lord,"
Amos;3;11;"Therefore thus says the Lord God:"
Amos;3;12;"Thus says the Lord: “As the shepherd rescues from the mouth of the lion two legs, or a piece of an ear, so shall the people of Israel who dwell in Samaria be rescued, with the corner of a couch and part of a bed."

Amos;5;5;"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but do not seek Bethel,"
Amos;5;6;"Seek the Lord and live,"
Amos;5;7;"O you who turn justice to wormwood"
Amos;5;8;"He who made the Pleiades and Orion,"
Amos;5;9;"who makes destruction flash forth against the strong,"
Amos;5;10;"They hate him who reproves in the gate,"
Amos;5;11;"Therefore because you trample on the poor"

Amos;5;20;"Is not the day of the Lord darkness, and not light,"
Amos;5;21;"“I hate, I despise your feasts,"
Amos;5;22;"Even though you offer me your burnt offerings and grain offerings,"
Amos;5;23;"Take away from me the noise of your songs;"

Amos;6;7;"Therefore they shall now be the first of those who go into exile,"
Amos;6;8;"The Lord God has sworn by himself, declares the Lord, the God of hosts:"
Amos;6;9;"And if ten men remain in one house, they shall die."
Amos;6;10;"And when one's relative, the one who anoints him for burial, shall take him up to bring the bones out of the house, and shall say to him who is in the innermost parts of the house, “Is there still anyone with you?” he shall say, “No”; and he shall say, “Silence! We must not mention the name of the Lord.”"
Amos;6;11;"For behold, the Lord commands,"
Amos;6;12;"Do horses run on rocks?"
Amos;6;13;"you who rejoice in Lo-debar,"
Amos;6;14;"“For behold, I will raise up against you a nation,"
Amos;7;7;"This is what the Lord God showed me: behold, he was forming locusts when the latter growth was just beginning to sprout, and behold, it was the latter growth after the king's mowings."
Amos;7;2;"When they had finished eating the grass of the land, I said,"
Amos;7;3;"The Lord relented concerning this:"
Amos;7;4;"This is what the Lord God showed me: behold, the Lord God was calling for a judgment by fire, and it devoured the great deep and was eating up the land."
Amos;7;5;"Then I said,"
Amos;7;6;"The Lord relented concerning this:"
Amos;7;7;"This is what he showed me: behold, the Lord was standing beside a wall built with a plumb line, with a plumb line in his hand."
Amos;7;8;"And the Lord said to me, “Amos, what do you see?” And I said, “A plumb line.” Then the Lord said,"
Amos;7;9;"the high places of Isaac shall be made desolate,"
Amos;7;10;"Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, “Amos has conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel. The land is not able to bear all his words."
Amos;7;11;"For thus Amos has said,"
Amos;7;12;"And Amaziah said to Amos, “O seer, go, flee away to the land of Judah, and eat bread there, and prophesy there,"
Amos;7;13;"but never again prophesy at Bethel, for it is the king's sanctuary, and it is a temple of the kingdom.”"
Amos;7;14;"Then Amos answered and said to Amaziah, “I was no prophet, nor a prophet's son, but I was a herdsman and a dresser of sycamore figs."
Amos;7;15;"But the Lord took me from following the flock, and the Lord said to me, ‘Go, prophesy to my people Israel.’"
Amos;7;16;"Now therefore hear the word of the Lord."
Amos;7;17;"Therefore thus says the Lord:"
Amos;8;8;"This is what the Lord God showed me: behold, a basket of summer fruit."
Amos;8;2;"And he said, “Amos, what do you see?” And I said, “A basket of summer fruit.” Then the Lord said to me,"
Amos;8;3;"The songs of the temple shall become wailings in that day,”"
Amos;8;4;"Hear this, you who trample on the needy"
Amos;8;5;"saying, “When will the new moon be over,"
Amos;8;6;"that we may buy the poor for silver"
Amos;8;7;"The Lord has sworn by the pride of Jacob:"
Amos;8;8;"Shall not the land tremble on this account,"
Amos;8;9;"“And on that day,” declares the Lord God,"
Amos;8;10;"I will turn your feasts into mourning"
Amos;8;11;"“Behold, the days are coming,” declares the Lord God,"
Amos;8;12;"They shall wander from sea to sea,"
Amos;8;13;"“In that day the lovely virgins and the young men"
Amos;8;14;"Those who swear by the Guilt of Samaria,"
Amos;9;9;"I saw the Lord standing beside the altar, and he said:"
Amos;9;2;"“If they dig into Sheol,"
Amos;9;3;"If they hide themselves on the top of Carmel,"
Amos;9;4;"And if they go into captivity before their enemies,"
Amos;9;5;"The Lord God of hosts,"
Amos;9;6;"who builds his upper chambers in the heavens"
Amos;9;7;"“Are you not like the Cushites to me,"
Amos;9;8;"Behold, the eyes of the Lord God are upon the sinful kingdom,"
Amos;9;9;"“For behold, I will command,"
Amos;9;10;"All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword,"
Amos;9;11;"“In that day I will raise up"
Amos;9;12;"that they may possess the remnant of Edom"
Amos;9;13;"“Behold, the days are coming,” declares the Lord,"
Amos;9;14;"I will restore the fortunes of my people Israel,"
Amos;9;15;"I will plant them on their land,"
