Isaiah;6;3;"And one called to another and said:"
Isaiah;6;4;"And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke."
Isaiah;6;5;"And I said: “Woe is me! For I am lost; for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts!”"
Isaiah;6;6;"Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having in his hand a burning coal that he had taken with tongs from the altar."
Isaiah;6;7;"And he touched my mouth and said: “Behold, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away, and your sin atoned for.”"
Isaiah;6;8;"And I heard the voice of the Lord saying, “Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?” Then I said, “Here I am! Send me.”"
Isaiah;6;9;"And he said, “Go, and say to this people:"
Isaiah;6;10;"Make the heart of this people dull,"
Isaiah;6;11;"Then I said, “How long, O Lord?”"
Isaiah;6;12;"and the Lord removes people far away,"
Isaiah;6;13;"And though a tenth remain in it,"
Isaiah;7;7;"In the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, son of Uzziah, king of Judah, Rezin the king of Syria and Pekah the son of Remaliah the king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to wage war against it, but could not yet mount an attack against it."
Isaiah;7;2;"When the house of David was told, “Syria is in league with Ephraim,” the heart of Ahaz and the heart of his people shook as the trees of the forest shake before the wind."
Isaiah;7;3;"And the Lord said to Isaiah, “Go out to meet Ahaz, you and Shear-jashub your son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool on the highway to the Washer's Field."
Isaiah;7;4;"And say to him, ‘Be careful, be quiet, do not fear, and do not let your heart be faint because of these two smoldering stumps of firebrands, at the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria and the son of Remaliah."
Isaiah;7;5;"Because Syria, with Ephraim and the son of Remaliah, has devised evil against you, saying,"
Isaiah;7;6;"“Let us go up against Judah and terrify it, and let us conquer it for ourselves, and set up the son of Tabeel as king in the midst of it,”"
Isaiah;7;7;"thus says the Lord God:"
Isaiah;7;8;"For the head of Syria is Damascus,"
Isaiah;7;9;"And the head of Ephraim is Samaria,"
Isaiah;7;10;"Again the Lord spoke to Ahaz:"
Isaiah;7;11;"“Ask a sign of the Lord your God; let it be deep as Sheol or high as heaven.”"
Isaiah;7;12;"But Ahaz said, “I will not ask, and I will not put the Lord to the test.”"
Isaiah;7;13;"And he said, “Hear then, O house of David! Is it too little for you to weary men, that you weary my God also?"
Isaiah;7;14;"Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel."
Isaiah;7;15;"He shall eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse the evil and choose the good."
Isaiah;7;16;"For before the boy knows how to refuse the evil and choose the good, the land whose two kings you dread will be deserted."
Isaiah;7;17;"The Lord will bring upon you and upon your people and upon your father's house such days as have not come since the day that Ephraim departed from Judah—the king of Assyria!”"
Isaiah;7;18;"In that day the Lord will whistle for the fly that is at the end of the streams of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria."
Isaiah;7;19;"And they will all come and settle in the steep ravines, and in the clefts of the rocks, and on all the thornbushes, and on all the pastures."
Isaiah;7;20;"In that day the Lord will shave with a razor that is hired beyond the River—with the king of Assyria—the head and the hair of the feet, and it will sweep away the beard also."
Isaiah;7;21;"In that day a man will keep alive a young cow and two sheep,"
Isaiah;7;22;"and because of the abundance of milk that they give, he will eat curds, for everyone who is left in the land will eat curds and honey."
Isaiah;7;23;"In that day every place where there used to be a thousand vines, worth a thousand shekels of silver, will become briers and thorns."
Isaiah;7;24;"With bow and arrows a man will come there, for all the land will be briers and thorns."
Isaiah;7;25;"And as for all the hills that used to be hoed with a hoe, you will not come there for fear of briers and thorns, but they will become a place where cattle are let loose and where sheep tread."
Isaiah;8;8;"Then the Lord said to me, “Take a large tablet and write on it in common characters, ‘Belonging to Maher-shalal-hash-baz.’"
Isaiah;8;2;"And I will get reliable witnesses, Uriah the priest and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah, to attest for me.”"
Isaiah;8;3;"And I went to the prophetess, and she conceived and bore a son. Then the Lord said to me, “Call his name Maher-shalal-hash-baz;"
Isaiah;8;4;"for before the boy knows how to cry ‘My father’ or ‘My mother,’ the wealth of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria will be carried away before the king of Assyria.”"
Isaiah;8;5;"The Lord spoke to me again:"
Isaiah;8;6;"“Because this people has refused the waters of Shiloah that flow gently, and rejoice over Rezin and the son of Remaliah,"
Isaiah;8;7;"therefore, behold, the Lord is bringing up against them the waters of the River, mighty and many, the king of Assyria and all his glory. And it will rise over all its channels and go over all its banks,"
Isaiah;8;8;"and it will sweep on into Judah, it will overflow and pass on, reaching even to the neck, and its outspread wings will fill the breadth of your land, O Immanuel.”"
Isaiah;8;9;"Be broken, you peoples, and be shattered;"
Isaiah;8;10;"Take counsel together, but it will come to nothing;"
Isaiah;8;11;"For the Lord spoke thus to me with his strong hand upon me, and warned me not to walk in the way of this people, saying:"
Isaiah;8;12;"“Do not call conspiracy all that this people calls conspiracy, and do not fear what they fear, nor be in dread."
Isaiah;8;13;"But the Lord of hosts, him you shall honor as holy. Let him be your fear, and let him be your dread."
Isaiah;8;14;"And he will become a sanctuary and a stone of offense and a rock of stumbling to both houses of Israel, a trap and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem."
Isaiah;8;15;"And many shall stumble on it. They shall fall and be broken; they shall be snared and taken.”"
Isaiah;8;16;"Bind up the testimony; seal the teaching among my disciples."
Isaiah;8;17;"I will wait for the Lord, who is hiding his face from the house of Jacob, and I will hope in him."
Isaiah;8;18;"Behold, I and the children whom the Lord has given me are signs and portents in Israel from the Lord of hosts, who dwells on Mount Zion."
Isaiah;8;19;"And when they say to you, “Inquire of the mediums and the necromancers who chirp and mutter,” should not a people inquire of their God? Should they inquire of the dead on behalf of the living?"
Isaiah;8;20;"To the teaching and to the testimony! If they will not speak according to this word, it is because they have no dawn."
Isaiah;8;21;"They will pass through the land, greatly distressed and hungry. And when they are hungry, they will be enraged and will speak contemptuously against their king and their God, and turn their faces upward."
Isaiah;8;22;"And they will look to the earth, but behold, distress and darkness, the gloom of anguish. And they will be thrust into thick darkness."
Isaiah;9;9;" But there will be no gloom for her who was in anguish. In the former time he brought into contempt the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but in the latter time he has made glorious the way of the sea, the land beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations."
Isaiah;9;2;" The people who walked in darkness"
Isaiah;9;3;"You have multiplied the nation;"
Isaiah;9;4;"For the yoke of his burden,"
Isaiah;9;5;"For every boot of the tramping warrior in battle tumult"
Isaiah;9;6;"For to us a child is born,"
Isaiah;9;7;"Of the increase of his government and of peace"
Isaiah;9;8;"The Lord has sent a word against Jacob,"
Isaiah;9;9;"and all the people will know,"
Isaiah;9;10;"“The bricks have fallen,"
Isaiah;9;11;"But the Lord raises the adversaries of Rezin against him,"
Isaiah;9;12;"The Syrians on the east and the Philistines on the west"
Isaiah;9;13;"The people did not turn to him who struck them,"
Isaiah;9;14;"So the Lord cut off from Israel head and tail,"
Isaiah;9;15;"the elder and honored man is the head,"
Isaiah;9;16;"for those who guide this people have been leading them astray,"
Isaiah;9;17;"Therefore the Lord does not rejoice over their young men,"
Isaiah;9;18;"For wickedness burns like a fire;"
Isaiah;9;19;"Through the wrath of the Lord of hosts"
Isaiah;9;20;"They slice meat on the right, but are still hungry,"
Isaiah;9;21;"Manasseh devours Ephraim, and Ephraim devours Manasseh;"
Isaiah;10;10;"Woe to those who decree iniquitous decrees,"
Isaiah;10;2;"to turn aside the needy from justice"
Isaiah;10;3;"What will you do on the day of punishment,"
Isaiah;10;4;"Nothing remains but to crouch among the prisoners"
Isaiah;10;5;"Woe to Assyria, the rod of my anger;"
Isaiah;10;6;"Against a godless nation I send him,"
Isaiah;10;7;"But he does not so intend,"
Isaiah;10;8;"for he says:"
Isaiah;10;9;"Is not Calno like Carchemish?"
Isaiah;10;10;"As my hand has reached to the kingdoms of the idols,"
Isaiah;10;11;"shall I not do to Jerusalem and her idols"
Isaiah;10;12;"When the Lord has finished all his work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem, he will punish the speech of the arrogant heart of the king of Assyria and the boastful look in his eyes."
Isaiah;10;13;"For he says:"
Isaiah;10;14;"My hand has found like a nest"
Isaiah;10;15;"Shall the axe boast over him who hews with it,"
Isaiah;10;16;"Therefore the Lord God of hosts"
Isaiah;10;17;"The light of Israel will become a fire,"
Isaiah;10;18;"The glory of his forest and of his fruitful land"
Isaiah;10;19;"The remnant of the trees of his forest will be so few"
Isaiah;10;20;"In that day the remnant of Israel and the survivors of the house of Jacob will no more lean on him who struck them, but will lean on the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, in truth."
Isaiah;10;21;"A remnant will return, the remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God."
Isaiah;10;22;"For though your people Israel be as the sand of the sea, only a remnant of them will return. Destruction is decreed, overflowing with righteousness."
Isaiah;10;23;"For the Lord God of hosts will make a full end, as decreed, in the midst of all the earth."
Isaiah;10;24;"Therefore thus says the Lord God of hosts: “O my people, who dwell in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrians when they strike with the rod and lift up their staff against you as the Egyptians did."
Isaiah;10;25;"For in a very little while my fury will come to an end, and my anger will be directed to their destruction."
Isaiah;10;26;"And the Lord of hosts will wield against them a whip, as when he struck Midian at the rock of Oreb. And his staff will be over the sea, and he will lift it as he did in Egypt."
Isaiah;10;27;"And in that day his burden will depart from your shoulder, and his yoke from your neck; and the yoke will be broken because of the fat.”"
Isaiah;10;28;"He has come to Aiath;"
Isaiah;10;29;"they have crossed over the pass;"
Isaiah;10;30;"Cry aloud, O daughter of Gallim!"
Isaiah;10;31;"Madmenah is in flight;"
Isaiah;10;32;"This very day he will halt at Nob;"
Isaiah;10;33;"Behold, the Lord God of hosts"
Isaiah;10;34;"He will cut down the thickets of the forest with an axe,"
Isaiah;11;11;"There shall come forth a shoot from the stump of Jesse,"
Isaiah;11;2;"And the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him,"
Isaiah;11;3;"And his delight shall be in the fear of the Lord."
Isaiah;11;4;"but with righteousness he shall judge the poor,"

Isaiah;11;6;"The wolf shall dwell with the lamb,"
Isaiah;11;7;"The cow and the bear shall graze;"

Isaiah;11;10;"In that day the root of Jesse, who shall stand as a signal for the peoples—of him shall the nations inquire, and his resting place shall be glorious."
Isaiah;11;11;"In that day the Lord will extend his hand yet a second time to recover the remnant that remains of his people, from Assyria, from Egypt, from Pathros, from Cush, from Elam, from Shinar, from Hamath, and from the coastlands of the sea."
Isaiah;11;12;"He will raise a signal for the nations"
Isaiah;11;13;"The jealousy of Ephraim shall depart,"
Isaiah;11;14;"But they shall swoop down on the shoulder of the Philistines in the west,"
Isaiah;11;15;"And the Lord will utterly destroy"

Isaiah;13;20;"It will never be inhabited"
Isaiah;13;21;"But wild animals will lie down there,"
Isaiah;13;22;"Hyenas will cry in its towers,"

Isaiah;14;2;"And the peoples will take them and bring them to their place, and the house of Israel will possess them in the Lord's land as male and female slaves. They will take captive those who were their captors, and rule over those who oppressed them."
Isaiah;14;3;"When the Lord has given you rest from your pain and turmoil and the hard service with which you were made to serve,"

Isaiah;36;11;"Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said to the Rabshakeh, “Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it. Do not speak to us in the language of Judah within the hearing of the people who are on the wall.”"
Isaiah;36;12;"But the Rabshakeh said, “Has my master sent me to speak these words to your master and to you, and not to the men sitting on the wall, who are doomed with you to eat their own dung and drink their own urine?”"
Isaiah;36;13;"Then the Rabshakeh stood and called out in a loud voice in the language of Judah: “Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria!"
Isaiah;36;14;"Thus says the king: ‘Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you."
Isaiah;36;15;"Do not let Hezekiah make you trust in the Lord by saying, “The Lord will surely deliver us. This city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.”"
Isaiah;36;16;"Do not listen to Hezekiah. For thus says the king of Assyria: Make your peace with me and come out to me. Then each one of you will eat of his own vine, and each one of his own fig tree, and each one of you will drink the water of his own cistern,"
Isaiah;36;17;"until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and wine, a land of bread and vineyards."
Isaiah;36;18;"Beware lest Hezekiah mislead you by saying, “The Lord will deliver us.” Has any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?"
Isaiah;36;19;"Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?"
Isaiah;36;20;"Who among all the gods of these lands have delivered their lands out of my hand, that the Lord should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?’”"
Isaiah;36;21;"But they were silent and answered him not a word, for the king's command was, “Do not answer him.”"
Isaiah;36;22;"Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the secretary, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and told him the words of the Rabshakeh."
Isaiah;37;37;"As soon as King Hezekiah heard it, he tore his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth and went into the house of the Lord."
Isaiah;37;2;"And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the secretary, and the senior priests, covered with sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz."
Isaiah;37;3;"They said to him, “Thus says Hezekiah, ‘This day is a day of distress, of rebuke, and of disgrace; children have come to the point of birth, and there is no strength to bring them forth."
Isaiah;37;4;"It may be that the Lord your God will hear the words of the Rabshakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to mock the living God, and will rebuke the words that the Lord your God has heard; therefore lift up your prayer for the remnant that is left.’”"
Isaiah;37;5;"When the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah,"
Isaiah;37;6;"Isaiah said to them, “Say to your master, ‘Thus says the Lord: Do not be afraid because of the words that you have heard, with which the young men of the king of Assyria have reviled me."
Isaiah;37;7;"Behold, I will put a spirit in him, so that he shall hear a rumor and return to his own land, and I will make him fall by the sword in his own land.’”"
Isaiah;37;8;"The Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah, for he had heard that the king had left Lachish."
Isaiah;37;9;"Now the king heard concerning Tirhakah king of Cush, “He has set out to fight against you.” And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,"
Isaiah;37;10;"“Thus shall you speak to Hezekiah king of Judah: ‘Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you by promising that Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria."
Isaiah;37;11;"Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, devoting them to destruction. And shall you be delivered?"
Isaiah;37;12;"Have the gods of the nations delivered them, the nations that my fathers destroyed, Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the people of Eden who were in Telassar?"
Isaiah;37;13;"Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, the king of Hena, or the king of Ivvah?’”"
Isaiah;37;14;"Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up to the house of the Lord, and spread it before the Lord."
Isaiah;37;15;"And Hezekiah prayed to the Lord:"
Isaiah;37;16;"“O Lord of hosts, God of Israel, enthroned above the cherubim, you are the God, you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; you have made heaven and earth."
Isaiah;37;17;"Incline your ear, O Lord, and hear; open your eyes, O Lord, and see; and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which he has sent to mock the living God."
Isaiah;37;18;"Truly, O Lord, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations and their lands,"
Isaiah;37;19;"and have cast their gods into the fire. For they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone. Therefore they were destroyed."
Isaiah;37;20;"So now, O Lord our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you alone are the Lord.”"
Isaiah;37;21;"Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, “Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: Because you have prayed to me concerning Sennacherib king of Assyria,"
Isaiah;37;22;"this is the word that the Lord has spoken concerning him:"
Isaiah;37;23;"“‘Whom have you mocked and reviled?"
Isaiah;37;24;"By your servants you have mocked the Lord,"
Isaiah;37;25;"I dug wells"
Isaiah;37;26;"“‘Have you not heard"
Isaiah;37;27;"while their inhabitants, shorn of strength,"
Isaiah;37;28;"“‘I know your sitting down"
Isaiah;37;29;"Because you have raged against me"
Isaiah;37;30;"“And this shall be the sign for you: this year you shall eat what grows of itself, and in the second year what springs from that. Then in the third year sow and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat their fruit."
Isaiah;37;31;"And the surviving remnant of the house of Judah shall again take root downward and bear fruit upward."
Isaiah;37;32;"For out of Jerusalem shall go a remnant, and out of Mount Zion a band of survivors. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will do this."
Isaiah;37;33;"“Therefore thus says the Lord concerning the king of Assyria: He shall not come into this city or shoot an arrow there or come before it with a shield or cast up a siege mound against it."
Isaiah;37;34;"By the way that he came, by the same he shall return, and he shall not come into this city, declares the Lord."
Isaiah;37;35;"For I will defend this city to save it, for my own sake and for the sake of my servant David.”"
Isaiah;37;36;"And the angel of the Lord went out and struck down 185,000 in the camp of the Assyrians. And when people arose early in the morning, behold, these were all dead bodies."
Isaiah;37;37;"Then Sennacherib king of Assyria departed and returned home and lived at Nineveh."
Isaiah;37;38;"And as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, Adrammelech and Sharezer, his sons, struck him down with the sword. And after they escaped into the land of Ararat, Esarhaddon his son reigned in his place."
Isaiah;38;38;"In those days Hezekiah became sick and was at the point of death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said to him, “Thus says the Lord: Set your house in order, for you shall die, you shall not recover.”"
Isaiah;38;2;"Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Lord,"
Isaiah;38;3;"and said, “Please, O Lord, remember how I have walked before you in faithfulness and with a whole heart, and have done what is good in your sight.” And Hezekiah wept bitterly."
Isaiah;38;4;"Then the word of the Lord came to Isaiah:"
Isaiah;38;5;"“Go and say to Hezekiah, Thus says the Lord, the God of David your father: I have heard your prayer; I have seen your tears. Behold, I will add fifteen years to your life."
Isaiah;38;6;"I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria, and will defend this city."
Isaiah;38;7;"“This shall be the sign to you from the Lord, that the Lord will do this thing that he has promised:"
Isaiah;38;8;"Behold, I will make the shadow cast by the declining sun on the dial of Ahaz turn back ten steps.” So the sun turned back on the dial the ten steps by which it had declined."
Isaiah;38;9;"A writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, after he had been sick and had recovered from his sickness:"
Isaiah;38;10;"I said, In the middle of my days"
Isaiah;38;11;"I said, I shall not see the Lord,"
Isaiah;38;12;"My dwelling is plucked up and removed from me"
Isaiah;38;13;"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"
Isaiah;38;14;"Like a swallow or a crane I chirp;"
Isaiah;38;15;"What shall I say? For he has spoken to me,"
Isaiah;38;16;"O Lord, by these things men live,"
Isaiah;38;17;"Behold, it was for my welfare"
Isaiah;38;18;"For Sheol does not thank you;"
Isaiah;38;19;"The living, the living, he thanks you,"
Isaiah;38;20;"The Lord will save me,"
Isaiah;38;21;"Now Isaiah had said, “Let them take a cake of figs and apply it to the boil, that he may recover.”"
Isaiah;38;22;"Hezekiah also had said, “What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the Lord?”"
Isaiah;39;39;"At that time Merodach-baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent envoys with letters and a present to Hezekiah, for he heard that he had been sick and had recovered."
Isaiah;39;2;"And Hezekiah welcomed them gladly. And he showed them his treasure house, the silver, the gold, the spices, the precious oil, his whole armory, all that was found in his storehouses. There was nothing in his house or in all his realm that Hezekiah did not show them."
Isaiah;39;3;"Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah, and said to him, “What did these men say? And from where did they come to you?” Hezekiah said, “They have come to me from a far country, from Babylon.”"
Isaiah;39;4;"He said, “What have they seen in your house?” Hezekiah answered, “They have seen all that is in my house. There is nothing in my storehouses that I did not show them.”"
Isaiah;39;5;"Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of the Lord of hosts:"
Isaiah;39;6;"Behold, the days are coming, when all that is in your house, and that which your fathers have stored up till this day, shall be carried to Babylon. Nothing shall be left, says the Lord."
Isaiah;39;7;"And some of your own sons, who will come from you, whom you will father, shall be taken away, and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.”"
Isaiah;39;8;"Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “The word of the Lord that you have spoken is good.” For he thought, “There will be peace and security in my days.”"
Isaiah;40;40;"Comfort, comfort my people, says your God."
Isaiah;40;2;"Speak tenderly to Jerusalem,"
Isaiah;40;3;"A voice cries:"
Isaiah;40;4;"Every valley shall be lifted up,"
Isaiah;40;5;"And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed,"
Isaiah;40;6;"A voice says, “Cry!”"
Isaiah;40;7;"The grass withers, the flower fades"
Isaiah;40;8;"The grass withers, the flower fades,"
Isaiah;40;9;"Go on up to a high mountain,"
Isaiah;40;10;"Behold, the Lord God comes with might,"
Isaiah;40;11;"He will tend his flock like a shepherd;"
Isaiah;40;12;"Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand"
Isaiah;40;13;"Who has measured the Spirit of the Lord,"
Isaiah;40;14;"Whom did he consult,"
Isaiah;40;15;"Behold, the nations are like a drop from a bucket,"
Isaiah;40;16;"Lebanon would not suffice for fuel,"
Isaiah;40;17;"All the nations are as nothing before him,"
Isaiah;40;18;"To whom then will you liken God,"
Isaiah;40;19;"An idol! A craftsman casts it,"
Isaiah;40;20;"He who is too impoverished for an offering"
Isaiah;40;21;"Do you not know? Do you not hear?"
Isaiah;40;22;"It is he who sits above the circle of the earth,"
Isaiah;40;23;"who brings princes to nothing,"
Isaiah;40;24;"Scarcely are they planted, scarcely sown,"
Isaiah;40;25;"To whom then will you compare me,"
Isaiah;40;26;"Lift up your eyes on high and see:"
Isaiah;40;27;"Why do you say, O Jacob,"
Isaiah;40;28;"Have you not known? Have you not heard?"
Isaiah;40;29;"He gives power to the faint,"
Isaiah;40;30;"Even youths shall faint and be weary,"
Isaiah;40;31;"but they who wait for the Lord shall renew their strength;"

Isaiah;44;14;"He cuts down cedars, or he chooses a cypress tree or an oak and lets it grow strong among the trees of the forest. He plants a cedar and the rain nourishes it."
Isaiah;44;15;"Then it becomes fuel for a man. He takes a part of it and warms himself; he kindles a fire and bakes bread. Also he makes a god and worships it; he makes it an idol and falls down before it."
Isaiah;44;16;"Half of it he burns in the fire. Over the half he eats meat; he roasts it and is satisfied. Also he warms himself and says, “Aha, I am warm, I have seen the fire!”"
Isaiah;44;17;"And the rest of it he makes into a god, his idol, and falls down to it and worships it. He prays to it and says, “Deliver me, for you are my god!”"
Isaiah;44;18;"They know not, nor do they discern, for he has shut their eyes, so that they cannot see, and their hearts, so that they cannot understand."
Isaiah;44;19;"No one considers, nor is there knowledge or discernment to say, “Half of it I burned in the fire; I also baked bread on its coals; I roasted meat and have eaten. And shall I make the rest of it an abomination? Shall I fall down before a block of wood?”"
