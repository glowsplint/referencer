Hosea;3;3;"And I said to her, “You must dwell as mine for many days. You shall not play the whore, or belong to another man; so will I also be to you.”"
Hosea;3;4;"For the children of Israel shall dwell many days without king or prince, without sacrifice or pillar, without ephod or household gods."
